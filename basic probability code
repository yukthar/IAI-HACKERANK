# Total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice
total_possible_outcomes = 6 * 6

# Number of favorable outcomes where dice values are different and sum is 6
favorable_outcomes = 4

# Calculate the probability as a fraction
probability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_possible_outcomes)

# Print the probability in the required format
print(probability)
